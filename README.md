# Image-Classification-using-ANN

# Fashion MNIST

In this notebook, we will work with fashion MNIST dataset to carry out a classification exercise using Artificial Neural Networks.


## About the dataset

The dataset, Fashion MNIST, is a collection of apparel images falling into several classes. 
Classes are numbered from 0 to 0 and have the following meanings with Tshirt/Top represented as 0 and an Ankle Boot as 9. 

class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']


## Objective

In this exercise, we will create a simple ANN model to classify the images into some categories


## Toolkit

We will use TensforFlow, tensorflow implementation of keras on google colab for this exercise.
